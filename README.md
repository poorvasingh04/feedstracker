    <section aria-labelledby="about">
      <h2 id="about">1. Who we are and what this policy covers</h2>
      <p>FeedsTracker is a baby feeding tracker provided by <strong>[REPLACE_WITH_LEGAL_NAME_OR_BUSINESS_NAME]</strong>
        ("we", "us", or "the developer"). This policy describes the iPhone and Android apps, the web version,
        and this policy page. Contact us at <strong>[REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL]</strong>.</p>
      <p>Feeding records are stored locally on your device. FeedsTracker has no account system, developer-operated
        cloud database, or cloud synchronization. This does not mean that no third party processes data:
        Google advertising services, your operating system, and website hosting providers may process information
        as described below.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="local">
      <h2 id="local">2. Feeding records and other local information</h2>
      <p>FeedsTracker stores the information needed to operate the tracker in local device storage
        (browser storage in the web version and the app's local web storage in the native apps). This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your baby's optional name and required date of birth.</li>
        <li>Breastfeeding records, including side, start and end times, and any session in progress. Duration is calculated from timestamps.</li>
        <li>Bottle records, including the amount, selected unit (ml or oz), and feed time. Bottle records have no end time or duration.</li>
        <li>Reminder preferences and scheduling information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information supports feed tracking, editing, history, active-session recovery, and reminders.
        The app does not upload these records to the developer or send baby details or feeding records to Google AdMob.
        There is no in-app account, cloud sync, or separate feeding-usage analytics service.</p>
      <p>Local storage is not a guarantee of confidentiality. Someone who can access your device or browser profile
        may be able to access the records. Use your device's security controls. Operating-system backups, browser
        behavior, and device migration may affect local data under the relevant provider's settings and policies;
        FeedsTracker does not provide its own backup or sync service.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="notifications">
      <h2 id="notifications">3. Local notifications</h2>
      <p>If you choose to enable reminders and grant notification permission, the iPhone or Android operating system
        schedules a local feeding reminder on your device. Reminders do not use a developer-operated push-notification
        server and do not require an account. The web version can save reminder preferences but does not schedule
        these native reminders.</p>
      <p>You can manage reminders in Settings and revoke notification permission in your device settings.
        Notification text may appear on your lock screen depending on your device's notification privacy settings.
        Your operating system processes the information needed to deliver local notifications.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="ads">
      <h2 id="ads">4. Google AdMob advertising and third-party processing</h2>
      <p>The iPhone and Android apps use Google AdMob banner advertising. The web version does not request AdMob ads.
        Native banners are eligible on Home (including idle, active breastfeeding, and bottle-entry states) and History;
        Setup and Settings are ad-free. Whether an ad actually appears depends on privacy eligibility, availability,
        and successful loading.</p>
      <p>Google and advertising partners involved in delivering or measuring ads may collect or process information
        such as IP address, device and app information, advertising or other identifiers where available and permitted,
        approximate location derived from IP address, ad impressions, interactions, and diagnostic information.
        The exact processing depends on platform, SDK behavior, region, and your privacy choices.</p>
      <p>Third-party processing may support ad delivery, measurement, fraud prevention, security, and, where permitted,
        personalization. Non-personalized or limited ads do not mean that no data is processed. Google and its partners
        may process information on servers outside your country, subject to their policies and applicable safeguards.</p>
      <p>For details, read:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services</a></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="consent">
      <h2 id="consent">5. Consent and privacy choices</h2>
      <p>The native apps use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request current consent information before
        requesting ads and to display Google's official consent form when required. Consent information is refreshed
        on launch, on resume, and after you manage privacy choices. UMP stores consent signals on your device.</p>
      <p>The app uses the live UMP result and available consent signals to determine whether it can request
        personalized, non-personalized, or limited ads, or must request no ads. Personalized advertising is used only
        where the relevant signals permit it; where regional consent is not required, Google's SDK applies other
        applicable regional signals. A changed decision causes the current banner to be removed or re-requested.</p>
      <p>In the native apps, open <strong>Settings → Privacy &amp; Ads → Manage privacy choices</strong> to reopen Google's
        privacy-options form when UMP makes it available. This control may be unavailable when Google does not require
        privacy options in your region. Withdrawing personalization consent can result in non-personalized or limited
        ads rather than removing every ad; if no ad request is eligible, the app requests no banner.</p>
      <p>You can also use your device's advertising and privacy controls. Changing advertising choices does not delete
        your feeding history. Conversely, deleting feeding records does not reset Google's consent choices or erase
        information already processed by third parties.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="hosting">
      <h2 id="hosting">6. Websites, hosting, and support</h2>
      <p>Visiting the web version or this policy page sends normal web-request information, such as your IP address
        and browser details, to the relevant hosting provider. When this policy is hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub
        processes visitor information under the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.
        This policy page itself includes no advertising SDK, analytics script, or form.</p>
      <p>Hosting and development services may process technical logs or error diagnostics to operate and troubleshoot
        the web version or development previews. This is distinct from uploading feeding records or running
        feeding-usage analytics.</p>
      <p>If you contact us by email, the developer and email providers process the information you choose to send
        and your email address to respond. Please do not send baby details or feeding records unless necessary for
        your request.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="retention">
      <h2 id="retention">7. Retention, deletion, and your rights</h2>
      <p>Local records remain on your device until you delete them or local storage is removed. You can delete individual
        feeds or use <strong>Settings → Data → Delete all data</strong> to remove the app's stored baby profile, feeding
        history, active session, and reminder settings. Clearing browser or app storage can also remove records;
        uninstalling may remove app data depending on the platform. Device backups may retain copies separately.</p>
      <p>Because the developer does not receive or hold your local feeding records, we cannot retrieve, restore,
        or remotely delete them. Third parties determine retention of data they process under their own policies;
        deleting local app data does not delete their records. Support correspondence is kept only as needed to
        address your request and meet applicable legal obligations.</p>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing,
        obtain portability, and withdraw consent without affecting prior lawful processing. Contact us about information
        we hold, and use Google's privacy controls for information Google processes. Where applicable, you may also
        complain to your local data-protection authority.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="children">
      <h2 id="children">8. Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>FeedsTracker is intended for parents and adult caregivers, not for children to use independently.
        Baby information entered by a caregiver is stored locally as described above and is not intentionally sent
        to the developer or advertising services. The app is not a service for collecting information directly from children.</p>
      <p>If you believe a child has provided personal information to us through support or another direct contact,
        contact us so we can investigate and take appropriate action. The fact that the app records baby information
        does not exempt third-party advertising from applicable children's privacy requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="changes">
      <h2 id="changes">9. Policy changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes to the app, third-party services, or legal requirements.
        The effective date above identifies the current version. Material changes will be communicated as required
        by applicable law. Review this page periodically for updates.</p>
